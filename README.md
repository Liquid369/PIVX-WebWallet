### Installation
To use this web wallet locally click the clone or download button, then chose download as a zip. Unzip the file. Once it is unzipped, open the index.html  
file in your favorite **_MODERN_** browser.
In order to generate new address **_Only For Testing_** you must change the debug setting to
false in the walletBuilt.js file, or in the wallet.js file and rebuild it using browserify
### USE
The current setup allows for users to generate one private key and one public key. This is not a HD Wallet (Hierarchical deterministic Wallet) and because of that you must remember to back up every private key you generate. There is no one master. Losing any of the private keys you generate could result in the loss of funds.
